## Usage

To run the project, clone the repo, navigate to the root directory, and type `npm install` in a new terminal window.

Once the *node_modules* folder has been created and all the dependencies have been successfully installed. 

Run `npm run start` which will compile the project and allow you to view the app locally.

Note: The project has already been set up with a live reloader. This will compile and reload the web page on your localhost port automatically when you save any file in the project. Therefore, you will NOT have to run `npm run start` every time.
